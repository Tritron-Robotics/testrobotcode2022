# robotcode2022
## What the project does:
This First Robotics project contains the code for Team 7323â€™s robot.


## Why the project is useful:
 This project, originally a FRC sample, can serve as a base for other projects revolving around FRC robots. It contains the code for the basic functions of intake motors, drivetrain motors, shooting motors, etc.

## How to get started:
Follow this to get your computer setup with all of the FRC software.
Once everything is setup, you can clone this repository, and open the folder in 2022 WPILib VS Code.

3. Commit changes locally to your new branch:
    - `git add .`
    - `git commit -m "my really awesome feature"
4. Push local changes to remote repositry (github):
    - `git push`
5. Make pull request on github:
